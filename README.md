# FairPCA

A python implementation of Samadi et al's [Fair PCA](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8294-the-price-of-fair-pca-one-extra-dimension.pdf) paper (Samadi, Samira, et al. "The price of fair pca: One extra dimension." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2018).

We evaluate the effectiveness of Fair PCA in terms of equalized odds.
